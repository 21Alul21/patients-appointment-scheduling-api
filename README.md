# MedManage API â€“ Multi-Tenant Medical Management System

## Project Description
MedManage is a Spring Boot REST API for managing healthcare organizations. It provides a subscription based system, enabling subscribed organizations to effectively create, shedule and manage appointments between patients and doctors in an organization. It contains a free trial duration for organizations to test the application before choosing to pay for a subscription. 

## Functional Workflow
An organization (hospital) registers to use the service through an organization admin, the admin either chooses to use the service initially in a trial mode (free without charge for a short duration) or outrightly pay for subscription over a preferred duration.

with subscription paid, organization admins can register patients and doctors to their organization. Registered patients can book appointments with doctors within the same organization and get feedback on doctor availability.

## User Stories
- As an organization admin, I want to register my organization so that we can use the appointment system.
- As an organization admin, I want to select a trial or subscription plan so that I can evaluate or use the service long-term.
- As an organization admin, I want to register doctors and patients to our organization so that they can interact on the platform.
- As a patient, I want to book an appointment with a doctor in my organization so that I can receive medical attention.
- As a doctor, I want to receive notifications about appointment requests so that I can confirm or decline based on my availability.
