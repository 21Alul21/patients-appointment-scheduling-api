# MedManage API â€“ Multi-Tenant Medical Management System

## Project Description
MedManage is a Spring Boot REST API for managing healthcare organizations. It provides a subscription based system, enabling subscribed organizations to effectively create, shedule and manage appointments between patients and doctors in an organization. It contains a free trial duration for organizations to test the application before choosing to pay for a subscription. 

## User Story
An organization (hospital) registers through to use the service through an organization admin, the admin either chooses to use the service initially in a trial mode (free without charge for a short duration) or outrightly pay for subscription over a preferred duration.

with subscription paid, organization admins can register patients and doctors to their organization. Registered patients can book appointments with doctors within an organization and doctors and get feedback on doctor availability.
